# Semantic HTML & Accessibility Project
This project is all about building a robust foundation in web development by focusing on Semantic HTML, accessibility, and SEO optimization. My goal is to create web pages that are not just visually structured, but also highly usable for everyone, including screen reader users, and easily discoverable by search engines.

Through a series of incremental tasks, I'll be learning to:

  -**Master Semantic HTML:** Properly structure web content using tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better organization and inherent accessibility.

  -**Optimize for SEO:** Utilize appropriate meta tags and sound document structure to boost webpage visibility.

  -**Enhance Accessibility:** Implement ARIA roles and attributes to ensure content and forms are accessible to users with disabilities.

  -**Design User-Friendly Forms:** Apply best practices for creating accessible and intuitive web forms.

This project emphasizes progressive enhancement, building on each task to deepen my understanding of these crucial modern web development practices. It's about making the web better for all!
