## Semantic HTML & Accessibility Project
This project is all about building a robust foundation in web development by focusing on Semantic HTML, accessibility, and SEO optimization. My goal is to create web pages that are not just visually structured, but also highly usable for everyone, including screen reader users, and easily discoverable by search engines.

Through a series of incremental tasks, I'll be learning to:

  -**Master Semantic HTML:** Properly structure web content using tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better organization and inherent accessibility.

  -**Optimize for SEO:** Utilize appropriate meta tags and sound document structure to boost webpage visibility.

  -**Enhance Accessibility:** Implement ARIA roles and attributes to ensure content and forms are accessible to users with disabilities.

  -**Design User-Friendly Forms:** Apply best practices for creating accessible and intuitive web forms.

This project emphasizes progressive enhancement, building on each task to deepen my understanding of these crucial modern web development practices. It's about making the web better for all!

## CSS Grid and Flexbox
Building on the strong foundation of semantic HTML and accessibility, this project now dives into CSS Grid and Flexbox, two powerful CSS layout modules that are essential for crafting modern, responsive web designs.

CSS Grid: Think of Grid as a 2-dimensional layout system. It allows you to design complex page layouts by dividing a page into rows and columns, giving you precise control over the positioning and sizing of elements. It's ideal for defining the overall page structure (e.g., header, sidebar, main content, footer).

Flexbox: Flexbox, on the other hand, is a 1-dimensional layout system. It excels at distributing space among items in a single row or a single column. It's perfect for aligning items within a component (e.g., navigation links in a header, items in a card).

In this project, I will be leveraging these core CSS concepts directly through Tailwind CSS utility classes. Tailwind provides intuitive classes like grid, grid-cols-3, gap-4 for Grid, and flex, justify-between, items-center, space-x-4 for Flexbox. This utility-first approach allows for rapid development of complex, responsive layouts directly in the HTML, ensuring adaptability across all device sizes.
